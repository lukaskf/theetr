## Development Process
* Database Model - This is really the most important step. Good SQl modeling builds the foundation of your
  entire application. If you model your relationships well in the database, then 
  all your application has to do is extract the information. I've had some good
  practice, so this step comes intuitively and writing down on a whiteboard or paper/pencil
  the model out by hand. Business logic and requirements dictate the model, so this step
  is reading problem description and translating it to SQL db model.

* Install Tools - I love slim.

* CRUD for DB Models - Normally in my role I never use scaffolding, and I don't like how it
bloats an application. I also think using it might not demonstrate my abilities as well as doing
  the steps manually for setting up migrations, controllers, models, views..etc. However, the tools
  are nice and fit this situation nicely: I need to efficiently create an application that will
  not grow much. So I ended up using scaffolding, because at the end of the day we should
  choose the right tools for the job.
